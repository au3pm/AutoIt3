OVERVIEW
========

   AutoIt is copyrighted software distributed under the terms
   of the GNU General Public License (hereinafter the "GPL").

   The stub (AutoItSC.bin) which is imbedded in each AutoIt compiled 
   script is part of AutoIt, and contains code that is under our copyright. 
   The terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compiling
   a script is a special form of linking with our stub.

   As a special exception we grant the free usage of AutoIt compiled
   scripts, including commercial programs.
   See below for details and restrictions.

SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR COMPILED EXECUTABLES
==========================================

   The stub (AutoItSC.bin) which is imbedded in each AutoIt compiled 
   script is part of AutoIt, and contains code that is under our copyright. 
   The terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compiling

   Jonathan Bennett and the AutoIt team grant you special permission to 
   freely use and distribute all AutoIt compiled scripts (including 
   commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:

   1. You must compile your script with a completely unmodified AutoIt
      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)
      with a self compiled version of the unmodified AutoIt sources as
      distributed by us.
   2. This also implies that the AutoIt stub must be completely unmodified 
      (with the exception of the stub file version information that you MAY
      modify if you wish).


ANNOTATIONS

  - You can use a modified AutoIt version or modified AutoIt stub only for
    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.

  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all AutoIt
    compiled programs.

  - You can integrate all or part of AutoIt into projects that are compatible
    with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant any special exceptions
